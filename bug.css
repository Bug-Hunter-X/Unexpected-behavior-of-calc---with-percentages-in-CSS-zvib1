The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, if you use it with a percentage value, it can lead to unexpected results if the container's size is not yet determined when the calculation is performed. For example, if you try to set the width of an element to `calc(50% - 10px)`, and the container's width is initially unknown, the calculation might not be correct.
